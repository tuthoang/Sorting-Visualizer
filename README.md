# Sorting-Visualizer

Implementing a web page that visualizes the different sorting algorithms.
<br />
Written in Pure Javascript, HTML, CSS.
<br />
The algorithms I implemented are:
1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quick  Sort
5. Merge Sort

The height of the bars are randomly created.
<br />
Slide the Number of Elements bar to increase or decrease the number of bars.
<br />
Slide the Animation Speed bar to increase or decrease the speed of the sort (the animation).
<br />
