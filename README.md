# Sorting-Visualizer

Implementing a web page that visualizes the different sorting algorithms.
The algorithms I implemented are:
1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quick  Sort
5. Merge Sort

The height of the bars are randomly created.

Slide the Number of Elements bar to increase or decrease the number of bars.
Slide the Animation Speed bar to increase or decrease the speed of the sort (the animation).
